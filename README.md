I have made a desktop based chatting aplication interface using java in which i have used graphical user interface for making frames and displaying the messages on frames
I have made one server class and one client class between them i can send messages
I have used socket programming for sending and reciving messages
I have tried to give these frames a desgine like whatsapp and it is like a desktop based application
